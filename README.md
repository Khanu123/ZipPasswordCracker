Zip Password Cracker
This Python script is a basic implementation of a ZIP file password cracker. It utilizes the zipfile module to attempt extracting the contents of a specified ZIP file ('test.zip') using passwords provided in a password list file ('passlist.txt'). The script iterates through the lines of the password list, trying each password until the correct one is found. If the password is correct, it prints the successful password to the console.

Usage
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Place the target ZIP file in the same directory as the script and name it 'test.zip'.
Create a password list file named 'passlist.txt' containing potential passwords, each on a separate line.
Run the script using the command python script.py.
Note: It's crucial to use this script responsibly and only on files for which you have explicit permission to perform password recovery.
